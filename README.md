* MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It's known for its scalability and ability to handle large volumes of data.
  
* ExpressJS: Express is a web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a robust set of features 
  for routing, middleware, and handling HTTP requests and responses.

* NodeJS: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side. It's event-driven and non-blocking, making it efficient for 
  building scalable and real-time applications.

* EJS (Embedded JavaScript): EJS is a templating language that allows you to generate HTML markup with JavaScript. It's commonly used with Express to create dynamic 
  web pages by embedding JavaScript code within HTML.

* Express Partials-Layouts: Express Partials and Layouts are middleware for Express that enable you to create reusable layouts and partial views in your web 
  application. This helps in organizing and maintaining a consistent structure across multiple pages.

* GulpJS: Gulp is a task runner built on Node.js that automates repetitive tasks in the development workflow, such as compiling CSS and JavaScript files, optimizing 
  images, and more. It's commonly used for streamlining the build process of web applications.

* Vanilla JS: Vanilla JS refers to using plain JavaScript without any additional libraries or frameworks. It's the core language of the web and is used for client-side 
  scripting to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

* RestFul CRUD APIs: REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
  operations are common actions performed on data in a database. RestFul CRUD APIs refer to using RESTful principles to create APIs that allow these CRUD operations to 
  be performed on data.
